# THE-SIMPLE-ARDUINO-WEATHER-WEB-SERVER
This project is to set up a home web server that could display the room temperature, humidity levels and also we monitor the led lights .This approach consists of an Arduino and an Ethernet shield, running a tiny web server sketch, and for this example, we are using the popular DHT-11 Temperature / Humidity sensor(to monitor temperature and humidity).We could use the above idea for many other sensors like gas sensor, LDR sensor (to calculate light intensity in the room) etc.
Make the connections according to circuit shown in led_connection.png and dht11_connection.png and also check for working of individual components by executing dht11test.ino and ledTest.ino files.
If everything is working fine then execute the main_client.ino file and type the ip (mentioned in the code) in on the url bar of your browser and check for working.
